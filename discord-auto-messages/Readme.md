Discord Auto Messages is a simple python script that was created for a random reason on a Discord server. My friends and I started sending spam in the chat to get XP from the MEE6 bot. But I, who was not in the patience to be always there typing, decided to create a python script that would work for me.

## Requirements

1. Install python3 on your machine - for help click [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)
2. Create a file "token.txt" and paste your Authorization token from Discord in plain text
3. Write your messages in the tuple "messages" on "main.py"

## Running the bot

1. Run on your shell/terminal:

Windows:

> python main.py {discord channel id} {delay in seconds between messages} {print the message (use 0 to false and 1 to true)}

Linux:

> python3 main.py {discord channel id} {delay in seconds between messages} {print the message (use 0 to false and 1 to true)}
